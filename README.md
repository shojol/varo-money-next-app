E-commerce website:

1.  Create a NextJS web application using typescript.
2.  Create two pages one to display the homepage with all the product cards and one for product details page.
3.  Homepage may contain:
    a) A top banner/hero image
    b) Dummy header and footed
    c) Add product/Edit Product/Delete product (Product should have fields like Image, Product Name, Product id(AutoGenerated), Product category(fixed List in Dropdown), Sellerâ€™s Email). Redirect to the add/update page for the operation and after operation is done redirect back to the home page
    d) Display products in cards format
    e) Add a Product search text box at the top of the home page.(Based on Product Name)
4.  Implement storage management of your choice to store the information of product (Redux, context, react state)
5.  Create a Product detail page to display product data after clicking on the tile. Use React Router to redirect.
6.  Write test cases using RTL.
7.  Implement Formik and Yup Validations for the Add/Update Product Form.

Note for designing: Use material UI and styled components. And make the pages responsive

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the DB

- start the DB by running the following console command in the extracted directory:

```bash
./pocketbase serve

```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
